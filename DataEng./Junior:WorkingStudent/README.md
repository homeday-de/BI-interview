## EL(T) implementation

Building data pipelines and designing data models is one of the daily tasks of a data engineer.

This task requires you to implement a partial transformation of one of Homeday's data ELT pipelines, which interfaces with an external API.

You will find 2 JSON files which were extracted and anonymized from the API. **They need you to make a transformation to be the CSV format.**
Each file represents an application for the loan. In our scenario, these data will be stored as raw data in the database for its downstream data models.

Please approach via Python and save your functions, data models in the Python script (not Jupyter notebook). Attach your GitHub repo or gist once you are finished.
Enjoy coding!
